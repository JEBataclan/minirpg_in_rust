# Mini-RPG in Rust

To be honest, this should've been long finished if I just made it simple. If I didn't create a structs for the weapons, armors, identities, etc. But there will be more, of course. It's somehow necessary anyway for good coding practices.

### My TODO list as of 7/26/2024 2:16AM
- [ ] Make use of Result<> intead of Option<> on some areas
- [ ] Battle system
- [ ] Generate multiple enemies in one battle
- [ ] Subclass (AKA Race)
- [ ] Gold+Shop system
- [ ] Mana+Spell system
